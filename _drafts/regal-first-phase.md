Spent the night working on regal, making it responsive and mobile friendly. I still do not like how the page looks on mobiles, nothing wrong in it. layout adjusts as it is supposed to. It is just the lack of sidebar makes the page look kind of too.. plain?

**Notes to self:**

1. Improve how Regal's main page Looks on Phones
2. Consider improving looks by darkening colors, the front end looks a little.. old-fashioned as of now.
