Hey blog, you are going to go through a cleanup :). Just submitted my GSOC proposal and that means I got some spare time now.
Contributing to the chassis project has made me realize the importance of clean and systematic code and following strict and uniform coding style. SO while I wait for comments on the proposal - in which case I may have to edit it - I am going to clean up the code on my repos, setup code style checking and Unit testing too!
Hurrah! to that.
