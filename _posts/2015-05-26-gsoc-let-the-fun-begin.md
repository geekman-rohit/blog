So it begins. The **first day of Google Summer of Code** has come and gone, and its been a good first day.
Since my last post, quite a lot has happened on planet GSOC.

I have decided to create a **proof of concept demo app** in **week-1**, while we discuss issues with the community. 
We plan to start the discussion on our [Github repo](https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.css-chassis.com) by raising topics as issues today.

Meanwhile I have started work on the demo app. I am using express without any template engine, as the api is supposed to only respond with json.
The Server will also render static files, but that needs no template engine.

The work on demo app will likely take another day or two, at the most. My next post will be after I finish it, or if something significant happens before that.
