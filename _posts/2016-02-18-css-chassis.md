It has been a while since I wrote here on this blog. Life has been busy. Since my last post in June, my website and blog stayed unupdated, GSOC 2015 happened, I got myself into a full time job, and joined the [css-chassis](http://css-chassis.com) team at jQuery Foundation.

Also we at css-chassis are planning to participate in GSOC 2016 under jQuery Foundation. I am hoping we would have some good contributors under gsoc.
