Looks like GSOC is becoming more popular. The student list was declared last night and the google-melange website turned slow! It takes a quite a lot of traffic to do that.
<br />
Some 15 minutes later, I received an email titled **'Congratulations! You have been accepted into Google Summer of Code 2015'**

So looks like my summer is gonna be awesome this year.
On with preparations now.
<br />
Thank you, ***GSOC team*** and ***jQuery Foundation***.
