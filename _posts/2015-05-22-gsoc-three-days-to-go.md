It's been a long time since I posted, and the last one month has been awesome.

The community bonding period has gone well, my mentor and I have recognized issues that we may face and the chassis team has already found some solutions, basically, making my life easier.

So we have decided to use some extremely light weight framework/http-server for node, so I donot need to worry about setting basic things up. 
We are considering using [express.js](https://github.com/strongloop/express/)/ [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) or [node-connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect)

Sarah, my mentor, init the themeroller repo last night. We are officially in business :).
Here's the github repo : [themeroller.css-chassis.com](https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.css-chassis.com)
