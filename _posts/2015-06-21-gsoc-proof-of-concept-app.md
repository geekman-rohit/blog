So, 4 weeks have gone by since GSOC coding started, and things are now getting exciting in planet GSOC. 

We hae created a small proof of concept app in the first three weeks, while discussing things. We also made a lot of major decisions
like what database to use and what kind of api we were going to support.
Repo for The Proof of Concept app can be found here : [https://github.com/geekman-rohit/themeroller-demo](https://github.com/geekman-rohit/themeroller-demo)

We have deicided to use node.js with a mysql database.
I am starting coding on the main app from tomorrow, and it's getting super exciting.
