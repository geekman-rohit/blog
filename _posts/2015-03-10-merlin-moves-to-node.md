title: Moving Merlin Chat to Node
categories: [coding]
---
Started studying Node and it is awesome. Not only do I get to code server side in javasript, but there are tools available as node modules that have already made my life easy.

Moved Merlin to Node tonight.
There is an implementation of [XEP-206](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0206.html) *BOSH* available as a node module and that makes setup easier. It can be started from within node script.
Also, I cannot really afford to host a BOSH server myself right now, so this is the ideal solution.


I must find more time to code for Merlin, it still has 3 major tasks pending.
