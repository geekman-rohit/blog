<h2 class="article-heading">About Me</h2>

  <p>
      I am <a href="http://www.rohit.codes">Rohit Mulange</a>. I also go by geekman.
      <br />
      I am a Web Programmer with passion for html5 and JavaScript games.
      <br />
      The Web has over the years turned into an extremely powerful platform, and I love taking leverage of it to make fantastic applications.
      I quit job Recently and decided to spend some time following my passion. I currently work on any game ideas that come to my mind.
      <br />
      I have also recently started open sourcing any games I make.
      <br />
      <br />

      You will find the code of games I make at <a href="https://github.com/tinyjsgames">github.com/tinyjsgames</a>
      <br />
      <br />
      Once Completed, you will find the games hosted at <a href="https://tinyjs.games">tinyjs.games</a>.
